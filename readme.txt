Adzapier provides you with the easiest way to insert the JavaScript for implementing Adzapierâ€™s Cookie Banner and providing the network path to get cookie consent records from your website users.

== GETTING STARTED ==
Adzapier helps you to automate best practices of data & privacy compliance so that you can focus on what matters most in your core business activities.

The Consumer consents are all safe and stored in a concise manner that works as your audit-proof record if you and your customers might need it in the future.

== FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS ==
